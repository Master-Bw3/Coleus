Just as values can be created, passed around, and used by spells, so can parts of the spell itself.


When nesting one circle as a glyph inside another, 
but not immediately providing any subcircles to the upper circle, 
the upper circle will return the inner circle as a fragment.

;;;;;

This fragment can then be used in a number of ways, including being written to an item using [Notulist's Ploy](^trickster:tricks/basic#4), 
and being cast later or even multiple times within the same spell.


It is also very possible to pass a spell fragment inside of itself, and execute it again there, 
using recursion to create what is essentially a loop.

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:execute,title=Grand Stratagem|>

spell, any... -> any

---

A powerful trick indeed, it executes the passed in spell fragment, 
providing it with all other passed in fragments as arguments.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:execute_same_scope,title=Quiet Distortion|>

spell -> any

---

Executes the given spell with the current spell's arguments.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:fork,title=Utensil Stratagem|>

spell, any... ->

---

An alternative to Grand Stratagem, this dispatches the given spell to a new spell slot, 
letting it run concurrently with this spell.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:iterator,title=Iteration Distortion|>

spell, any[] -> any[]

---

For each item in the given list, execute the given spell, creating a new list from the results.

;;;;;

Each execution receives three arguments:

---

any, number, any[]

---

Where the first argument is the item, the second is its index in the given list, 
and the third is the given list. The results of each execution are collected into a new list, 
which is the result of this glyph.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:try_catch,title=Cautious Stratagem|>

spell, spell, any... -> any

---

Attempts to execute the first spell. If it blunders, the second spell is run and the blunder is silenced. Excess values are arguments to both. 

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:supplier,title=Supply Distortion|>

any -> spell

---

Creates a new spell fragment which returns the previously provided fragment when executed.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:closure,title=Closure Stratagem|>

spell, [spell, any]... -> spell

---

Replaces any occurrence of any of the latter spell's patterns inside the first spell
with the fragment immediately following them.

;;;;;

<|page-title@lavender:book_components|title=Note: Arguments|>Fragments can be passed into executed spell fragments as arguments.
