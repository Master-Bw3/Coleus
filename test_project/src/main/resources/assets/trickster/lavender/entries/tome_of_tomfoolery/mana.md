Mana is what fuels your ploys. It's the cost of manipulating the world.


As is tradition, amounts of mana are measured in gandalfs, or G. 
Any amount of mana that is lesser than one kilogandalf (kG) is generally considered negligible. 
Most players have a maximum mana reserve of 240 kilogandalfs.

Keep in mind that once you run out of mana, any deficit will be drawn from your very life. 
Using mana in this way will consume your health, and is referred to as bloodcasting.
The average player has 40 kilogandalfs of mana in their blood.


Concretely, mana regenerates over time at 0.5%/s. Maximum mana is always equivalent to maximum health times twelve. 
Current blood mana is always equivalent to current health times two.
